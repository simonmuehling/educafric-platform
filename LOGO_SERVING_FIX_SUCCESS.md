# ✅ LOGO SERVING ISSUE - COMPLETELY FIXED

## 🎯 **Root Cause Identified**
The EDUCAFRIC logos were not displaying because of a static file serving issue in development mode. The Vite development server was not properly serving static files from the `public/` directory.

## 🔧 **Issue Details**
- **Problem**: Logo requests were returning HTML instead of actual image files
- **Cause**: Static files in `public/` were not being served by Vite dev server
- **Evidence**: `curl -I /educafric-logo-128.png` returned `Content-Type: text/html` instead of `image/png`

## ✅ **Solution Applied**
Copied logo files to the correct location for Vite serving:

```bash
# Created client/public directory for Vite static serving
mkdir -p client/public
cp public/educafric-logo-128.png client/public/
cp public/educafric-logo-512.png client/public/
```

## 🚀 **Verification Results**

### ✅ **Before Fix**
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
```
Logo requests returned HTML page instead of images.

### ✅ **After Fix**
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: image/png
Content-Length: 43818
```
Logo requests now return actual PNG images with correct headers.
