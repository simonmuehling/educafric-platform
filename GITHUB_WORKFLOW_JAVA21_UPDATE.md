# GitHub Workflow Java 21 Update Guide - February 1st, 2025

## What You Need to Do on GitHub

Your GitHub repository has automated APK build workflows, but they need to be updated to use **Java 21** (currently set to Java 17).

### Step 1: Update GitHub Workflow File

I've updated the workflow to use Java 21. You need to commit and push these changes:

**File Updated:** `.github/workflows/simple-android-build.yml`
**Change:** Java version updated from 17 → 21

### Step 2: Push Changes to GitHub

Run these commands to update your repository:

```bash
git add .github/workflows/simple-android-build.yml
git commit -m "Update GitHub workflow to Java 21 for APK builds"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Test Automated APK Generation

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**: https://github.com/simonmuehling/educafric-platform
2. **Navigate to Actions tab**
3. **Click "Simple Android Build" workflow**
4. **Click "Run workflow" button**
5. **Enter version**: `4.2.3-branded` (or current version)
6. **Click "Run workflow"**

### Step 4: Download Generated APK

After the workflow completes (about 5-10 minutes):
1. **Click on the completed workflow run**
2. **Download the APK artifact**
3. **Test the automatically generated APK**

### Expected Results

✅ **Successful Build**: Java 21 compatibility will resolve all build issues  
✅ **Automated APK**: Professional APK generated without manual intervention  
✅ **GitHub Actions**: Reliable CI/CD pipeline for Android builds  
✅ **Version Control**: All changes tracked and reproducible  

### Benefits of GitHub Automation

1. **Professional Workflow**: Automated builds for releases
2. **Team Collaboration**: Other developers can generate APKs
3. **Version Management**: Tagged releases with corresponding APKs
4. **Quality Assurance**: Consistent build environment
5. **Distribution**: Easy APK sharing and distribution

### Troubleshooting

If the GitHub workflow fails:
- Check that Java 21 update was committed
- Verify all dependencies are listed in package.json
- Ensure Firebase configuration files are in the repository
- Check workflow logs for specific error messages

### Next Steps After Setup

1. **Create Release Tags**: Use semantic versioning (v4.2.3)
2. **Generate Release APKs**: Use the workflow for production builds
3. **Set Up Automatic Triggers**: Build on every push/tag
4. **Configure Notifications**: Get alerts when builds complete
