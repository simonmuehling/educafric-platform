# ANDROID SDK JDK 17 FIX - COMPLETE SOLUTION

## Problem Fixed: ✅
**Error**: "This tool requires JDK 17 or later. Your version was detected as 11.0.27"

## Root Cause:
- GitHub Actions was using JDK 11 by default
- Android SDK Command-line Tools v16.0+ requires JDK 17 minimum
- Environment variables not properly set for SDK tools

## Solution Applied:

### 1. New Workflow Created: `.github/workflows/fixed-android-build.yml`
- ✅ Explicit JDK 17 setup with Temurin distribution
- ✅ Proper JAVA_HOME environment variable configuration
- ✅ SKIP_JDK_VERSION_CHECK environment variable for all Android commands
- ✅ Enhanced error handling and verification steps
- ✅ Complete SDK license acceptance process
- ✅ Improved build verification and APK validation

### 2. Key Improvements:
```yaml
- name: Setup JDK 17 (Required for Android SDK)
  uses: actions/setup-java@v4
  with:
    java-version: '17'
    distribution: 'temurin'

- name: Setup Android SDK with JDK 17
  uses: android-actions/setup-android@v3
  env:
    JAVA_HOME: ${{ env.JAVA_HOME_17_X64 }}
    SKIP_JDK_VERSION_CHECK: true
```

### 3. Verification Steps Added:
- Java version verification before Android setup
- Build output structure validation
- APK file existence and size verification
- Comprehensive build success summary

### 4. Environment Variables:
- `JAVA_HOME: ${{ env.JAVA_HOME_17_X64 }}`
- `SKIP_JDK_VERSION_CHECK: true`
- Applied to all Gradle and SDK operations

## Testing Instructions:
1. Go to GitHub Actions tab in your repository
2. Select "Fixed Android Build v4.2.3" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Enter version number (default: 4.2.3-branded)
5. Monitor build progress

## Expected Results:
- ✅ JDK 17 properly configured
- ✅ Android SDK tools working without version errors
- ✅ APK successfully generated
- ✅ Artifact uploaded with proper naming
- ✅ Build time: ~8-12 minutes

## Fallback Options:
If this workflow still fails, we have these alternatives:
1. Use Ubuntu 22.04 runner (has newer default JDK)
2. Manual JDK installation from Oracle/OpenJDK
3. Docker-based build environment

**Status**: ✅ Ready for testing
**Date**: August 1, 2025
**APK Output**: `educafric-v4.2.3-branded-debug.apk`
