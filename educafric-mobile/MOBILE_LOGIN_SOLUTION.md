## üîç If Still Having Issues

**Issue: Connection Test Fails**
- Make sure Replit development server is running (should show port 5000)
- Check if you can access http://localhost:5000 in your Mac browser
- Try restarting the mobile app

**Issue: Login Works But Dashboard Doesn't Load**
- Clear app data and try again
- Check for any JavaScript errors in the mobile app console

**Issue: Still Can't Connect**
Your computer's IP address might be needed instead of localhost:
1. Find your Mac's IP: `ifconfig en0 | grep inet`
2. Update `src/services/api.ts` to use your IP instead of localhost
3. Example: `http://192.168.1.45:5000`

## ‚ú® Additional Features Added

- **Connection Test Component**: Tests server connectivity before login attempts
- **Multiple Demo Account Buttons**: Quick access to different user roles
