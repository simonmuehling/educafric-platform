# Should I Test on PC or Android Phone?

## Option 1: Test on PC (Android Emulator) - RECOMMENDED FOR FIRST TEST

### Advantages:
✅ **Easier Setup** - No IP configuration needed  
✅ **No Phone Required** - Works entirely on your computer  
✅ **Faster Testing** - Quick to start and debug  
✅ **Already Configured** - The code is ready to work  

### How to Test:
1. Install Android Studio (includes emulator)
2. Run the mobile app:
   ```bash
   cd educafric-mobile
   npm run android
   ```
3. Virtual phone opens on your screen
4. Test login with demo credentials

### When to Choose This:
- First time testing the mobile app
- Want to see if everything works quickly
- Don't want to deal with IP configurations
- Developing and debugging features

## Option 2: Test on Real Android Phone

### Advantages:
✅ **Real Experience** - True mobile performance  
✅ **Share with Others** - Can install APK on multiple phones  
✅ **Actual Touch** - Real mobile interactions  
✅ **Production-like** - How users will actually use it  

### Requirements:
- Android phone with USB cable
- Find your computer's IP address
- Update the API configuration
- Enable Developer Mode on phone

### How to Test:
1. Find your computer's IP address
2. Update `educafric-mobile/src/services/api.ts`
3. Connect phone via USB
4. Run: `npm run android`
5. Or build APK and install manually

### When to Choose This:
- After testing on emulator works
- Want to show others the app
- Testing real device features (camera, GPS, etc.)
- Ready for final testing

## My Recommendation: Start with PC Emulator

**For your first test, use the PC emulator because:**

1. **No configuration needed** - It's already set up correctly
2. **Faster to test** - See results immediately
3. **Easier debugging** - All logs visible on your computer
4. **Less complexity** - No IP addresses or phone setup

**Then move to real phone** once you confirm everything works on the emulator.

## Quick Start Commands

### For PC Emulator:
```bash
cd educafric-mobile
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run android
```

### For Real Phone (after emulator works):
1. Update IP in `src/services/api.ts`
2. Same commands as above
3. Or build APK: `cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug`

Would you like to start with the PC emulator first?
