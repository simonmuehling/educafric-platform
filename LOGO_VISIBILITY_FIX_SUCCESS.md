# ✅ LOGO VISIBILITY ISSUE - COMPLETELY FIXED

## 🎯 **Problem Identified**
The EDUCAFRIC logos were not properly visible across the site due to conflicting logo references and broken import paths.

## 🔧 **Issues Found & Fixed**

### 1. **Conflicting Logo Variables**
- Multiple files had both `Logo` component imports AND `logoImage` variables
- This caused TypeScript errors and runtime failures

- ✅ Form wrapper now displays logo correctly

### 3. **Logo Component**
- `client/src/components/Logo.tsx` - Already working correctly
- Uses proper image path: `/educafric-logo-128.png`
- Includes proper sizing and styling
