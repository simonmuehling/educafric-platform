# Android SDK Configuration Status Report

## Current Status: ✅ PARTIALLY RESOLVED

### Android SDK Installation - SUCCESS ✅
- **Android SDK Tools**: Successfully installed to ~/android-sdk
- **Platform Tools**: Installed and configured
- **Build Tools**: Android 34.0.0 installed
- **Platforms**: Android API 34 and 35 available
- **Licenses**: All Android SDK licenses accepted

### Environment Configuration - SUCCESS ✅
- **ANDROID_HOME**: Configured to ~/android-sdk
- **local.properties**: Created in android/ directory with correct sdk.dir path
- **Path Configuration**: Android tools added to PATH

### Java Compatibility Issue - IN PROGRESS ⚠️
- **Current Java**: OpenJDK 17.0.7 installed via Nix
- **Required Java**: Some Capacitor modules require Java 21
- **Configuration Applied**: 
  - Modified android/app/build.gradle to use JavaVersion.VERSION_17
  - Added global Java 17 configuration in android/build.gradle
  - Disabled toolchain auto-download in gradle.properties

### Next Steps Required
1. **Verify Capacitor Module Configuration**: Check if modules can be configured for Java 17
2. **Alternative Solution**: Install Java 21 if modules absolutely require it
3. **Test Build**: Attempt build with current configuration

### Files Modified
- `android/local.properties` - Created with SDK path
- `android/app/build.gradle` - Updated Java version to 17
- `android/build.gradle` - Added global Java 17 configuration
- `android/gradle.properties` - Disabled toolchain auto-detection

### Technical Achievement
Successfully resolved the primary Android SDK issue that was blocking APK generation. The "SDK location not found" error has been eliminated and replaced with a Java version compatibility issue, which is significantly easier to resolve.
