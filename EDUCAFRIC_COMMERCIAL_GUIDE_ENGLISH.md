## üé≠ Commercial Scripts

### Phone Script - First School Contact

**Opening:**
"Hello, I'm [Name] from EDUCAFRIC, the educational platform designed for African schools. I'd like to tell you about how we help schools like yours save more than 50,000 CFA per year while improving parent communication. Do you have 2 minutes?"

**If interested:**
"Perfect! Currently, how do you manage student grades and parent communication? [Listen] I see. We help schools automate these processes. For example, [School X] now saves 70,000 CFA per year and their parents receive grades in real-time. May I show you how in 30 minutes next week?"

**If not the right time:**
"I understand you're busy. May I send you a 2-page brochure showing how [similar school] saved 60,000 CFA this year? What's your email?"

**Conclusion:**
"Perfect, I'll send that immediately and call you back [day] to see if this might interest you. Thank you for your time!"

### Parent Presentation Script - School Meeting

**Hook (2 minutes):**
"How many of you would like to know immediately if your child arrived safely at school? [Show of hands] And know their grades as soon as they're entered rather than at the end of term? [Show of hands] That's exactly what EDUCAFRIC enables."

**Problem (3 minutes):**
"Today, you often discover your child's difficulties too late. Report cards come after 3 months, sometimes your child misses school without you knowing, and communicating with teachers is complicated. Result: you can't help your child in time."

**Solution (5 minutes):**
"EDUCAFRIC changes all that. [Mobile demonstration] Look: school arrival notification, math grade received immediately, direct message to teacher. All this on your phone, even a basic phone with SMS."

**Price and value (3 minutes):**
"For 1,500 CFA per month - less than one tutoring session - you have access to everything. Compare: private tutoring 25,000 CFA/month, transport to see teachers 2,000 CFA/month. EDUCAFRIC: 1,500 CFA/month for complete monitoring."

**Call to action (2 minutes):**
"The first 50 parents registering today get the first month free. Who wants to give their child this extra chance to succeed?"

## üèÜ Closing Strategies

### School Closing Techniques

**1. ROI Closing**
"We calculated together that you save 70,000 CFA per year with EDUCAFRIC. Even if you only use it for 6 months, you're already ahead. When would you like to start saving?"

**2. Urgency Closing**
"We're only launching 50 schools this year to guarantee service quality. There are 8 spots left. Would you like to reserve one today?"

**3. Alternative Closing**
"Would you prefer to start at the beginning of next term or wait for the new school year? Either way, I'm offering you a free 1-month trial."

**4. Objection Closing**
"I sense there's still some hesitation. What's preventing you from saying yes today? [Listen] I understand. Here's how we address this point..."

### Parent Closing Techniques

**1. Emotional Closing**
"Imagine receiving an SMS 'Your child just got 18/20 in mathematics' instead of discovering their difficulties in 3 months. That's worth 1,500 CFA, isn't it?"

**2. Comparison Closing**
"1,500 CFA per month is less than a family pizza. But unlike pizza, this helps your child throughout their schooling."

**3. Group Closing**
"Look around you: these parents are registering because they want the best for their child. And you?"

## üìû Objection Management

### School Objections - Ready Responses

**"We don't have the budget this year"**
‚Üí "I understand. Let's calculate the cost of doing nothing: staff time wasted = X CFA, dissatisfied parents = student loss = Y CFA. EDUCAFRIC pays for itself in 3 months."

**"I need to discuss it with the board"**
‚Üí "Of course! May I prepare a 10-minute presentation with the numbers for your next meeting? When is it?"

**"What if it doesn't work?"**
‚Üí "Excellent question! That's why we offer a free 1-month trial. If you're not satisfied, you pay nothing and we delete everything."

**"Our teachers will resist change"**
‚Üí "That's normal! That's why we train each teacher individually. Generally, they become our biggest supporters when they see the time saved."

### Parent Objections - Ready Responses

**"1,500 CFA is expensive for me"**
‚Üí "I understand. That's why we have the basic plan at 1,000 CFA. And think about it: if this prevents just one academic failure, it's worth millions."

**"My phone is too old"**
‚Üí "No problem! EDUCAFRIC works on all phones, even the oldest ones. You'll receive alerts by SMS."

**"I don't understand technology"**
‚Üí "No need! It's as simple as receiving an SMS. Actually, would you like me to show you on your phone now?"

**"The school should pay for this"**
‚Üí "The school already pays its share for the basic system. But your premium access - with geolocation and detailed reports - is your personal investment in your child's future."
