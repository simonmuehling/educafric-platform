# ðŸ“± APK Generation - Next Steps

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status
You've created the GitHub release successfully! I can see the source code files (zip/tar.gz) which are automatically generated.

## ðŸš€ Generate the Actual APK

The APK generation requires a **manual workflow trigger** since GitHub releases only generate source code by default.

### Step 1: Trigger APK Build Workflow
1. **Go to**: https://github.com/simonmuehling/educafric-platform/actions
2. **Look for**: "Build Android APK - EDUCAFRIC v4" workflow
3. **Click**: "Run workflow" button (on the right side)
4. **Configure parameters**:
   - Build type: `release`
   - Version name: `4.2.1`
   - Version code: `4`
5. **Click**: "Run workflow"

### Step 2: Monitor Build Progress
- The workflow will take 5-10 minutes
- You'll see progress in the Actions tab
- Android SDK will be installed automatically
- Firebase integration will be included
- APK will be signed and optimized

### Step 3: Download APK
Once complete, you'll find:
- **APK file** in the workflow artifacts
- **File name**: `educafric-v4.2.1-release.apk`
- **Size**: ~15-25MB with all features included

## ðŸ“¦ Alternative: Manual Workflow Dispatch

If you don't see the workflow option:
1. **Go to**: https://github.com/simonmuehling/educafric-platform/actions/workflows/android-build.yml
2. **Click**: "Run workflow" dropdown
3. **Set**: Branch to `main`
4. **Configure**: Same parameters as above
5. **Run**: Click the green button

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Result

Your APK will include:
- Complete EDUCAFRIC educational platform
- All 8 user roles (Student, Parent, Teacher, etc.)
- Firebase integration (auth, push notifications)
- Geolocation tracking for student safety  
- Payment integration (Stripe + African methods)
- Communication system (SMS, WhatsApp, Email)
- Academic management features

**The source code is ready - now trigger the APK build workflow to get your installable Android app!**
